<p>This unique learning environment is what makes a Monroe education stand out. The incorporation of course work and real-world experience develops students' critical thinking and creative problem-solving skills while introducing them to new perspectives in their fields. As a result, undergraduates and graduates are better prepared for the success in their careers and ultimately, in life. Monroe College students are able to take courses over a three-semester-a-year academic calendar. This allows students to complete 45 credits in one year and to get their degree sooner than they thought possible.</p>
