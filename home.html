<h2>Our Veterans</h2>
<p>At Monroe, we provide the personal attention and
an environment that is both challenging and nurturing. A
place where your professors know you by name, take an
active interest in your academic program and your goals.
What's more, Monroe is committed to small classes, tutorial
sessions and a fully staffed Learning Resource Center to help
you along the way.</p>
<p> The
men and women who have enrolled at Monroe after their
military service have collaborated with our faculty and
administration to produce a veteran-friendly environment. As
a result, Monroe College now has one of the largest veteran
populations in the New York area.</p>
